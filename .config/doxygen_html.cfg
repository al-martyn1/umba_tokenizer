# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_HTML          = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html

# The HTML_FILE_EXTENSION tag can be used to specify the file extension for each
# generated HTML page (for example: .htm, .php, .asp).
# The default value is: .html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FILE_EXTENSION    = .html

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML header file for
# each generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard header.
#
# To get valid HTML the header file that includes any scripts and style sheets
# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            =
#_doc_utils/header.html

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            = 
#_doc_utils/footer.html

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading style
# sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to fine-tune the look of
# the HTML output. If left blank doxygen will generate a default style sheet.
# See also section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the style
# sheet that doxygen normally uses.
# Note: It is recommended to use HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET instead of this tag, as
# it is more robust and this tag (HTML_STYLESHEET) will in the future become
# obsolete.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_STYLESHEET        = 
#_doc_utils/mca.css

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# style sheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list). For an example see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  =

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath^ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that the
# files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_FILES       =

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use grayscales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to YES can help to show when doxygen was last run and thus if the
# documentation is up to date.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

#HTML_TIMESTAMP         = NO

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the

# With HTML_INDEX_NUM_ENTRIES one can control the preferred number of entries
# shown in the various tree structured indices initially; the user can expand
# and collapse entries dynamically later on. Doxygen will expand the tree to
# such a level that at most the specified number of entries are visible (unless
# a fully collapsed tree already exceeds this amount). So setting the number of
# entries 1 will produce a full collapsed tree by default. 0 is a special value
# representing an infinite number of entries and will result in a full expanded
# tree by default.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 9999, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES then doxygen generates three
# additional HTML index files: index.hhp, index.hhc, and index.hhk. The
# index.hhp is a project file that can be read by Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop
# (see: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138) on
# Windows.
#
# The HTML Help Workshop contains a compiler that can convert all HTML output
# generated by doxygen into a single compiled HTML file (.chm). Compiled HTML
# files are now used as the Windows 98 help format, and will replace the old
# Windows help format (.hlp) on all Windows platforms in the future. Compressed
# HTML files also contain an index, a table of contents, and you can search for
# words in the documentation. The HTML workshop also contains a viewer for
# compressed HTML files.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# The CHM_FILE tag can be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm
# file. You can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be
# written to the html output directory.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTMLHELP is set to YES.

CHM_FILE               =

# The HHC_LOCATION tag can be used to specify the location (absolute path
# including file name) of the HTML help compiler (hhc.exe). If non-empty,
# doxygen will try to run the HTML help compiler on the generated index.hhp.
# The file has to be specified with full path.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTMLHELP is set to YES.

HHC_LOCATION           =

# The GENERATE_CHI flag controls if a separate .chi index file is generated
# (YES) or that it should be included in the master .chm file (NO).
